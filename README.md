# Bakery Online - UI

This repository contains the user interface (UI) for the Bakery Online project. The project is still under development, adding new features and improving old ones

## Project Description

Bakery Online is a web application that enables the management of orders, products, and bakery users. The project focuses on two main panels: Admin and User.

### Admin Panel Features

- **Adding Products:** Ability to add new products to the bakery's offerings.
- **Managing Orders:** Reviewing orders, their statuses, and updating them.
- **User Management:** Viewing and editing user data.

### User Panel Features

- **Registration and Login:** Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Ordering Products:** Placing orders with the option for personal pickup at the bakery.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- Node.js version 12 or higher
- npm or Yarn

### Installation

To start working with the user interface, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Use the command `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all dependencies.

### Available Scripts

Within the project directory, you can use the following commands:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload automatically when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive mode.\
Refer to the [running tests section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) in the documentation for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production into the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the file names include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will still work, but they will refer to the copied scripts, allowing you to customize them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject`. The default configuration is suitable for small and medium deployments, so you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
